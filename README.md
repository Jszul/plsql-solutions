# Project Title

PL/SQL crash course

## Description

A compilation of the more challenging solutions from a PL/SQL crash course. The DB schemas used for these scenarios include a basic employee HR table; a table that consists of every day of the year, from January 1 to December 31, along with a ranking based on how many babies were born in the United States on that date between 1973 and 1999; and a table that emulates a video rental store database.
